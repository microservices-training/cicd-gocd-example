# GoCD Example Pipeline with Mule

A example pieline usign GoCD like CI Server tool.


# Environment Config

For this example we will use a containairized version of GoCD Server and Agent, both created using a **Docker** image.

## GoCD Config

### Server Config

```
docker pull gocd/gocd-server
```

### Agent Config
A custom image based on Ubuntu was choosen because it contains Java and cUrl already installed and run under user root by default.
Alpine based and other official versions images are available too.

```
docker pull jrandall/gocd-agent-ubuntu-18.04-docker
```
#### Installing Maven

```
apt update
```
```
apt install maven
```

After installed, verify it running
```
mvn -version
```

#### Downgrading to JDK 8 (Optional)
For this example we have as a prerequisite to use openjdk 8 instead of openjdk 11 so we need to downgrade the Open JDK version. The commands are:

```
apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
```
```
update-alternatives --config java
```

### Plugins Config (Optional)
There is a community plugin to run maven commands. This is out of scope of this article, however, just in case:
1) Download jar file from
https://github.com/ruckc/gocd-maven-plugin/releases/tag/0.1.1
2) Enter thee following location in container: /godata/plugins/external (Server)
3) Copy the jar in this location
4) Restart the server

# Pipeline Config

We'll use one single pipeline with different stages on it. One single material configured (Github) will trigger the execution of this simple pipeline.

- To create a pipeline click on "+ Add new pipeline"
	> First of all, configure a new material of type "git". Grab the repo url (HTTPS can be used) and paste it inside the Repository URL field
		> Test the connectivity to ensure you entered the proper URL
		> We'll skip advanced settings since this is a public repo that only contains one branch (master). However, consider that a more complex branching strategy will require more configuration
	> Enter the pipeline name. In this example we use the convention mule-${appName} to identify a mule app since the CI server can be used for other totally different purposes too.
		> Skip advanced settings since, again, the only parameters  we'll be using is the ones passed as argument for Deploy phase, and those can be environment variables inside the pipeline, instead arguments 

## Build Stage
This will package and test the application. For the sake of simplicity of this how-to, we'll keep the generated artifact in the GoCD filesystem, without versioning the binary using an external repo like Jfrog Artifactory or Nexus. However, it's strongly recommended to do that.
	
- The following configs should be configured as part of the pipeline config
	> Set Stage Name as "build-and-test" in the "Part 3: Stage Details"
		> We'll skip advance settings since we want to trigger the pipeline for every upcoming change notified by Github
	> Complete Part: Job and Tasks setting Job Name and giving "mvn package" as the command.
		> skip advanced settings since we don't need environment variables this time
	> Click on Save + Edit full config to configure the Deploy Stage

## Deploy Stage
This pipeline will get the packaged application (.jar) deloy it to Anypoint Platform and perform a quick connectivity healthcheck to ensure the application is up and running after deployment.
- From the pipeline configuration
	> Click on tab "Stages"
		> Click on "+ Add new stage"
			> Enter "deploy-and-test" as Job Name
			> Set Trigger Type as On Success and enabled check box "Allow Only On Success" to make sure this stage is only executed if build and test was succesfully
			> On Initial Job and Task
				> mvn-deploy for Job Name
				> Task Type "More"
				> On Lookup Commands enter Shell and select shell script
				> the command will be /bin/sh and the argument will be deployment.sh (this shellscrit will be provided by the application)
				> Click Save
		> Click on the deloy-and-test stage
			> Go to "Jobs"
				> Click on "mvn-deploy"
					> Click on "Environment Variables" tab
					> Enter the Mule Maven Plugin variables for the deloyment config. For example, for CloudHub:
						> username
						> environment (cloudhub)
						> env
					> Add the needed secure variables. Following the exampple for a CloudHub deployment:
						> password

					> Click "Save"
			> Click on the "Tasks" tab
				> Click on "+ Add new task", Click 'More"
					> On Command set "curl"
					> on Arguments set ${appName}-${region}.cloudhub.io or the convention used for the deployed application (depends on deployment model)
					> Check to run only if previous condition was passed (the deployment)
					> Click "Save"


# Running the pipeline

After configuring the pipeline you can go to "Dashboard" and click on the Start icon for your pipeline. Or simply change your code and push the changes to the Github repo.
